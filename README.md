# Fish_Movement_Code
A short project to test out different movement code done over summer of 2022.

This project was meant to evolve into a game, but the story and everything I had planned for it did not have any replayability factor and was flawed with the planned gameplay.

This project gave me more insight on how I should be planning development and I am glad that I started at all.

This project won't be continued.
